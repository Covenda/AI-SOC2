              Our Vulnerability Hunting service combines automated scanning, manual testing, and risk-based prioritization to help you identify and address security vulnerabilities before they become incidents. We go beyond traditional vulnerability scanning to actively hunt for security gaps in your environment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-neutral-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              Using the Covenda AI platform, we prioritize vulnerabilities based on business risk, not just CVSS scores. We analyze how vulnerabilities map to your actual systems, threat models, and business context to help you focus remediation efforts on what matters most.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-neutral-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              Our vulnerability hunting approach includes continuous monitoring, periodic deep-dive assessments, and integration with your existing vulnerability management processes. We help you build a sustainable vulnerability management program that reduces risk efficiently.
